Revision (Date 4-1-2010):

This sole source award, which was originally approved by Monroe Warren and Jan Dolan during August, 2007, is approved to be in effect for up to five years (from the origin date) as long as the factors for determining the sole source do not change prior to the five year period.

Because these hardware/software products and services are proprietary and are only available through a single source and because the City has an ongoing need for this technical solution, this award allows for City staff to acquire modifications, services, or additional components (including hardware, software, and licensing), from this vendor, to maintain, expand, or enhance the functionality of the system to enable the city to meet current or future operational needs, regulatory requirements, or other requirements without administering a competitive vendor selection process.

This authorization outlined a preliminary cost estimate of $250,000.  Based on the approval vote of City Council, the Purchasing Division established Emergency Purchase #07EP032 under which all necessary contracts and purchases would be managed.  As Facilities Management delved deeper into the project through a design contract with Omicron Engineering, the magnitude of the project became more complex and, therefore, more expensive.  Other components were discovered, that at the time of Council action, were unknown. The preliminary cost estimate was prepared on a very short notice, based on a best guess and cursory inspection of existing equipment and conditions.
