# City of Scottsdale Solicitations

The Solicitations dataset displays guidlines for businesses to submit bids for specific projects the city is undertaking.  Some of these seem to be recurring, such as landscaping services, others seem to be one time expenditures.

#### EDA
Approximately 1,000 solicitations have a date of '1900-01-01'(probably aproxy for no date).  1996 seems to be the first year of normal looking dates.
